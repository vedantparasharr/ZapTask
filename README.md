The app features a vibrant coral-themed design with a smooth gradient background. Tasks can be organized with dates, and completed tasks are visually distinguished with a strikethrough and darker background.

## 💻 Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/zaptask.git
```

2. Navigate to the project folder:
```bash
cd zaptask
```

3. Open `index.html` in your browser, and you're good to go!

No build process or dependencies needed - just pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 📂 Project Structure

```
zaptask/
│
├── index.html          # Main HTML structure
├── style.css           # All styling and responsive design
└── script.js           # Task logic and localStorage handling
```

## 🎨 Design Highlights

- **Color Palette**: Coral (#F38181), yellow (#FCE38A), mint (#EAFFD0), and teal (#95E1D3)
- **Smooth Interactions**: Hover effects and transitions for a polished feel
- **Mobile-First**: Fully responsive grid layout that adapts to any screen size
- **Clean UI**: Minimalist design that keeps focus on your tasks

## 🔧 How It Works

The app uses JavaScript's `localStorage` to save your tasks directly in your browser. Each task is stored as an object with:
- Task name
- Due date
- Completion status

When you add, complete, or delete a task, the app updates both the display and localStorage automatically.

## 📝 Future Improvements

Some ideas I'm thinking about adding:
- Task categories or tags
- Priority levels
- Filter tasks (all/active/completed)
- Edit existing tasks
- Dark mode toggle
- Task search functionality
